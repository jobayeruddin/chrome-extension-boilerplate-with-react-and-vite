# Chrome Extension (MV3) Boilerplate with React and Vite

Just some chilled boilerplate code to give you a headstart on building great Extensions.

Now it is a super minimal version but I'll try to update it frequently. Feel free to contribute.

## For Development

Run:

```
npm run dev
```

This command will build the extension and save it to a directory named "dev". It will watch for any changes on the files (not on manifest.json) and rebuild it on the "dev" directory.

You have to load the "dev" folder on Chrome.

## For Production

Run:

```
npm run build
```

This command will build the extension and save it to a directory named "dist".

You have to load the "dist" folder on Chrome.
